## INTRODUCTION

The Remote Feedback Form module generates a form adhering to YG guidelines. This webform is designed to connect to an external API, facilitating the transmission of emails to the respective departments through API integration.

The primary purpose of this module is to:

- **Build/Publish**:  Create a generic feedback form.
- **Collect**: Gather and transmit all comments to an API.

Goals:

- Present the standard styleable eServices feedback form.
- Safely transmit all submitted comments to the YG network instead of storing them, even temporarily, within the third-party cloud platform.


## REQUIREMENTS

This module depends on the following contributed modules:

  - Webform (https://www.drupal.org/project/webform): The Webform module allows you to build a form to collect data, which can be submitted to the YG API
  - Locale (Drupal core): this is what the translation of the form will generate
  - Fontawesome (https://www.drupal.org/project/fontawesome): This module will work with Font Awesome to add the icons 
  - Form Block(https://www.drupal.org/project/formblock): this will generate the block type Form.
  - YAML Content (https://www.drupal.org/project/yaml_content): This will create the block content Feedback form
  - Token (https://www.drupal.org/project/token)


## INSTALLATION

1. Download the module from GitLab.
2. Extract the module files into your Drupal modules directory (/modules/custom).
3. Enable the module through the Drupal administration interface or by using Drush: 
    ```

    ```
5. Ensure that all required dependencies are installed and enabled. If not, download and enable them following the aforementioned process in step 3.
6. To generate the block content, run the following command. You will be able to view it in /admin/content/block
    ```
    drush yaml-content-import-module remote_feedback_form
